# Action Operators

We have four operators for performing actions on objects in the Eve DB: add, set, remove and merge:

- [Add](add.md) ( `+=` ) - adds values to an attribute
- [Set](set.md) ( `:=` ) - sets the value of an attribute
- [Remove](remove.md) ( `-=` ) - removes attribute with value from an object
- [Merge](merge.md) ( `<-` ) - merges one object into another
