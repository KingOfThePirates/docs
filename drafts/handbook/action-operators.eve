# Action Operators

We have four operators for performing actions on objects in the Eve DB: add, set, remove and merge:

- Add ( `+=` ) - adds values to an attribute
- Set ( `:=` ) - sets the value of an attribute
- Remove ( `-=` ) - removes attribute with value from an object
- Merge (`<-`) - merges one object with another
