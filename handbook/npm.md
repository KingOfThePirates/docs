# Eve on npm

A package for Eve is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/witheve). After [installing npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform, you can download our package with the following command:

```
npm install -g witheve
```

This will give you a global Eve installation that you can invoke with the command `eve` from any folder. Doing so will launch an Eve server at `http://localhost:8080`.
