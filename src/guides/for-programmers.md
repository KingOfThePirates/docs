# Eve for Programmers

As a programmer, you probably find it easy to switch between different programming langauges. For instance, if you know Javascript, you probably wouldn't have a hard time learning similar langauges like C++, Java, or Python. That's because despite syntactic differences, these languages largely conform to the same programming model. When we program, in languages like these, we use similar abstractions between them -- loops, functions, and input/output patterns have become a staple of every programmer's toolbox. So it makes sense that when we solve problems, we think in terms of these primitive operations.

Eve is a different kind of programming langauge, so programmers new to Eve may feel a little lost at first. How do you get anything done in a language without loops, or even user defined functions? The purpose of this guide is to provide a mapping from the common tools you know, to the Eve way of solving problems.

## Functions

Functions are the fundamental unit of code reuse in most programming languages today. 

## Looping

### Map

### Reduce

### Recursion

## I/O
