# Getting Help

If you have any questions or get stuck while you are learning Eve, there are several ways to get help:

Before reaching out, make sure you've looked at the following resources:

- Read the [quick start guide](../../guides/quickstart). It contains everything you'll need to build your first Eve program.
- Read the [syntax reference](https://witheve.github.io/assets/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf). It summarized the syntax of Eve in a single page.

If you're still stick, you can get in touch with Eve developers and the community through these channels:

- Send a message to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk). We generally respond to messages within a day.
- Join the Eve Slack channel to talk with Eve developers and the community in real time _(coming soon)_

Hare are some more resources to help you learn Eve:

- Read the [quick start tutorial](https://github.com/witheve/docs/blob/master/drafts/guides/quickstart.md)
- Browse our growing [catalog of example applications](https://github.com/witheve/Eve/tree/master/examples) for something similar to what you're doing.
- Read our development [blog](http://incidentalcomplexity.com) to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes at Eve.
