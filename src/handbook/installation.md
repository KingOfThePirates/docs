# Getting Eve

There are several ways to get Eve. If you're running [Mac](../mac) or [Linux](../linux), you can install Eve natively on your system. If you're running [Windows 10](../windows), you can install Eve via Ubuntu for Windows. Unfortunately, Eve is not supported on earlier versions of Windows at this time.

You can also install Eve via [Docker](../docker). This works across Linux, Mac, and Windows 10.
