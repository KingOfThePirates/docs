# Databases

databases contain records

## Syntax

```eve
// search action
search @database1, ..., @databaseN

// Commit action
commit @database1, ..., @databaseN

// Bind action
bind @database1, ..., @databaseN
```

## Description

`<action> @database` performs the given action, one of `search`, `bind`, or `commit`, on the union of the provided databases.

If no database is provided with an action, then that action is performed on the default `@session` database.

## Special Databases

- `@session` - the default database, stores any record not associated explicitly with a database

- `@event` - holds records generated by user events in the DOM

- `@browser` - records stored in `@browser` are rendered as HTML by the browser

## Examples

Display a message when the DOM is clicked

```eve
search @event
  [#click #direct-target element]

commit @browser
  [#div text: "{{element} was clicked."]
```
