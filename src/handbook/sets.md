# Set Semantics

## Description

One other thing to know about Eve is that records follow [set semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)). Sets are collections where every element of the collection is unique. This is in contrast to bag semantics, where elements can be duplicated. We'll see the implications of this later, but it's important to keep in mind.
